. From Anypoint Platform > *Design Center*, create a Mule app and add a trigger such as an HTTP Listener.
. Create an HTTP element for the connector, by setting these fields:
+

|Field |Description
|Base path| Path where the Mule app listens for requests.
|Protocol | Selected for the HTTP endpoint, it can be HTTP or HTTPS (secure).
|Host| IP address where the Mule app listens for requests.
|Port| Address where the Mule app listens for requests.
|===
+
. Select the plus sign to add a component.

To create a reusable configuration for the connector, you can use only Basic Authentication.
