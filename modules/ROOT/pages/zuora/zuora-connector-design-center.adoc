== Configure in Design Center

Create applications using the Zuora connector. You can use an HTTP Listener or Scheduler as a trigger to initiate execution of the Mule flow.

The following instructions explain how to configure the Zuora connector using the HTTP listener:

. From the Anypoint Platform, click *Start Designing* in the Design Center section.
. Create a Mule application selecting the HTTP listener as a trigger, *Zuora Conector* as the target, and an operation, such as *Get All Refunds*.
. Conigure the HTTP global element for the connector by setting these fields.
