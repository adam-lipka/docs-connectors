Zuora Connector v1.0

The Anypoint Connector for Zuora lets you connect to the Zuora platform. The connector exposes all of the operations provided by Zuora's REST API.

== Audience

 * New user -- Read this document and configure your Mule application in xref:zuora/zuora-design-center.adoc[Design Center].
* Current Mule user -- Read this document and configure your Mule application in xref:zuora/zuora-design-center.adoc[Design Center] or xref:zuora/zuora-studio.adoc[Anypoint Studio].
The xref:zuora/zuora-config-topics.adoc[Configuration Topics] help you extend your understanding of Salesforce actions.
* Power user - Read the xref:zuora-connector-xml-maven.adoc[XML and Maven Support], xref:zuora/zuora-config-topics.adoc[Configuration Topics], and xref:zuora/zuora-use-cases.adoc[Use Cases].

== Prerequisites

 Requirements for using the connector:

* Login credentials to Zuora.
* Namespace and schema location: If you plan to create the XML for your Mule application, you need to include the correct namespace and schema location in your XML file. Anypoint Studio adds this information to the XML file automatically when you add the Zuora connector to a flow in a Mule app.

For hardware and software information, see the release notes.
