The Anypoint Custom Metrics connector enables you to send operational and business metric values from an application deployed to an on-premises server and managed in CloudHub to Anypoint Monitoring, where the metrics can be visualized in real time using custom dashboards. 

Once the metrics are in a custom dashboard, you can filter and group the metrics along the included dimensions. You can include multiple custom and built-in metrics in a single dashboard visualization.
